As many of you have noticed, we temporarily removed the option to set the default file manager from the store version of Files. We did this because the option had some unexpected side effects and we wanted to resolve those issues before bringing it back. Today, we're pleased to announce that we're bringing this option back with [Files v2.1.24]({'https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=pVFXwNFwveg&mid=24542&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2F9NGHP3DX8HDX'}). This option is still experimental, but we implemented several changes to improve the stability. If Files is already set as your default file manager, we recommend turning it off and on again to take advantage of the latest improvements.
